Project: Real-time Low-light Video Enhancement
Teammate: Gefei Shen, Shufan Sun
In this project, we aim to improve the camera's low-light video's quality in object visibility, nature color, and light balance. Methods include but not limited to de-blurring using gyroscope data, temporal/spacial de-noising, and potential ML-assisted de-noising methods. If an ML model is used, it must be able to run on a raspberry pi (to limit the computation it requires).
